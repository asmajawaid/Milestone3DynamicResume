To save the dynamically generated resume as a PDF, you can use a library like jsPDF or html2pdf. These libraries allow you to convert HTML content into a PDF file that users can download.

I'll show you how to implement this using html2pdf, which is a simple and widely used solution for this purpose.

1. Install html2pdf Library
To use html2pdf, you can include the library via a CDN. Add this <script> tag to your HTML file inside the <head> section or just before the closing </body> tag:

html
Copy code
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/html2pdf.js/0.9.3/html2pdf.bundle.min.js"></script>
2. Add a Button to Download PDF
Add a button below the generated resume for users to download the resume as a PDF:

html
Copy code
<button id="download-pdf">Download PDF</button>
3. Modify TypeScript to Save as PDF
Update your TypeScript code to include a function that converts the dynamically generated resume to a PDF:


// Handle PDF download
const downloadBtn = document.getElementById('download-pdf') as HTMLButtonElement;
downloadBtn.addEventListener('click', function() {
  const resume = document.getElementById('resume') as HTMLDivElement;
  html2pdf()
    .from(resume)
    .save('resume.pdf');
});
How it Works:
Form Submission: The user fills out the form, and the resume is dynamically generated as before.
Download PDF Button: When the Download PDF button is clicked, the content inside the #resume container is captured.
html2pdf Function: The html2pdf() function is triggered, converting the HTML content into a PDF and prompting the user to download the file.
Summary of Steps:
Add html2pdf library to your project via CDN or package manager.
Create a Download Button that the user clicks to download the PDF.
Use TypeScript to trigger the html2pdf conversion on button click and download the dynamically generated resume as a PDF.
Result:
This setup allows the user to input their resume details, view the dynamically generated resume, and download it as a PDF.
